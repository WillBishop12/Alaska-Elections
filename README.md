# Alaska-Elections

This is a project to analyze Alaska elections data at the precinct level in hopes of finding micro-level variations between precincts that show detailed patterns in voting behavior.

It uses only 2014 and 2016 data because before 2014, precinct boundaries were different.

My first attempt is a k-means clustering analysis.
